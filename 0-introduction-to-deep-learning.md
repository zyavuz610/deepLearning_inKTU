# Introduction to Deep Learning

Although machine learning has been around for years, two new trends have led to widespread use of machine learning:
* Large dataset
* Powerful and efficient parallel computing achieved by GPU computing.

As a result, new models and algorithms have been developed.

GPUs are 10-100 times more efficient than traditional CPUs. That's why data scientists use GPUs when processing big data.
The foundation of deep learning was laid when shallow artificial neural networks became deeper neural networks by increasing the number of layers.
