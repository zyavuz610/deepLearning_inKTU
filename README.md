This repository is the platform where I share the codes related to the my studies about artificial intelligence I made at Karadeniz Technical University.

Artificial Intelligence is a very popular subject or study field in these days. I recommend you to follow the order of topics below in order to master this subject and understand what is going on in the background.

* **Lineer Resgresion:** Linear regression is used to calculate a regression value. There are one-variable and multivariate versions. Basically, there is not much difference between the two.

* **Logistic Resression:** It is a type of regression used for binary classification. It works similarly to linear regression. The key difference is that the output in logictic regression is also given to a transfer function (usually sigmoid). In this way, values close to 0 or 1 are obtained instead of a linear value. Using a threshold of 0.5, the result can be converted to binary as 0 or 1.

* **Neural Network:** Single-layer or multi-layer (that is, with different architectures) neural networks actually consist of many nerve cells, which we call neurons. When each neuron is evaluated alone, it can be thought of as a classifier that performs logistic regression. After deep learning was discovered, such networks are also called **shallow neural networks**.

* **Deep Learning:** They are special neural network models with increased number of layers of neural networks and using different architectures and approaches. They are also called **Deep Neural Networks**.
